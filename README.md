Installation
------------

It's recommended to restart FlashDevelop after switching to another theme.

### Option 1

Download and open the easy-install set (SolarizedThemes.fdz) and let FlashDevelop install the themes in the user directory. Alternatively, drag and drop SolarizedThemes.fdz into FlashDevelop.

### Option 2

1. Download and extract the complete ZIP of the repository. The themes are in the `dist` folder.
2. Use FlashDevelop `Tools > Select UI Theme...` menu item, navigate to the `dist` folder, and pick a theme. An `.fdi` file contains the UI theme, an `.fdz` file in `SyntaxThemes` contains the syntax colorscheme and an `.fdz` file in `FullThemes` contains both.
